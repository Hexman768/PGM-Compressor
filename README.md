# CBinaryEncoder
This program reads in data from a PGM image specified as a command line argument and encodes it into unsigned characters in a much smaller file. This program is essentially a PGM image compressor. 
This program was written as part of a programming assignment in my C and Unix class, I just thought it was interesting enough to continue to build. 

# Compilation and Execution Instructions 
* Run "make all" to compile program
* Run "./main [input file] [output file]"
* Program code will execute and create an output file with the compressed data inside 

# Example
./main input.pgm output.dat
